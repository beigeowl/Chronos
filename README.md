# Chronos
Lightweight, minimalistic Windows time tracking app for ICS4U SDP

# Features
Chronos takes a minimalistic approach to screen time tracking on Windows.\
It graphs and lists screen time usage per app, across a day.\
When the interface is closed, it minimizes to the system tray and continues to track screen time.

# Installation
Ensure the entire repo is downloaded, every file is necessary for program function

To run Chronos as a Python file, you'll need to create a virtual environment (venv)\
From your terminal of choice, activate the venv (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all packages

## .exe compilation
If the program is to be run at startup, and as a .exe file, run `pyinstaller --onefile --windowed chronos.py` to compile the code into a .exe\
This can then be set as a startup Windows app by adding a shortcut to the .exe to the startup app folder
